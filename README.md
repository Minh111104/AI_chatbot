## Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, ensure the following:

1. **Python**: Install Python 3.7 or higher.
2. **Python Package**: Install the `openai` Python package:
   ```bash
        pip install openai
   ```
3. **Ollama Server**: Ensure the Ollama server is installed and running locally on `http://localhost:11434`. You can download Ollama from its official website.
